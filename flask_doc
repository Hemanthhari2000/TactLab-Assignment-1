-- using templates in flask.
-- main use of templates is to reduce the stress of writing inline HTML in the code.
-- we can make a template and then direct the flask application to the template and hence it will then render the page respectively.
-- we can create an directory called templates in the main directory.
-- finally, in the templates we can then add html files and write some html code in it.
-- then we can use "render_template()" in flask to render the html page.

* Dynamic Passing of Data between templates. *

-- we can now use the data passing where we can pass the data between templates and flask application.
-- we can use the "{{ VARIABLE }}" to pass the value from the flask python application to the html template.
-- In Templates we can also use the TEMPLATING LANGUAGE where we can write python code in html file using "{% STATEMENT %}".
-- 	we can also pass list or any other similar datatypes to the template and then render it out.
